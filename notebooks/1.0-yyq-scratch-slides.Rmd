# Slide 1

## header 1

Here is the first 5 examples from train

```{r}
train %>% 
    head() %>% 
    pander()
```


---

We note that there seems to be an outlier in terms of location

```{r}
train %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = X, y = Y)) +
    geom_point()
```

---

If we filter out the outlier, the plot improves, somewhat. It starts to kind of look like a city.

```{r}
train %>% 
    filter(Y < 50) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = X, y = Y)) +
    geom_point()
```
